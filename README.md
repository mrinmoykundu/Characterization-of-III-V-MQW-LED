# Characterization-of-III-V-MQW-LED

Multiple quantum well based (MQW) LED has several advantages over conventional bulk LED
in terms of enhanced radiative recombination probability and carrier confinement. In this project,
we propose to investigate the carrier dynamics and optical extraction mechanism of a MQW
structure using integrated analysis in MATLAB and Lumerical software. Our goals are-

- To investigate the characteristics of GaAs MQW LED devices for visible wavelength
emission.
- To analyze the effect of different parameters on the performance of III-Nitride MQW LED
devices for visible wavelength emission.
- To analyze spontaneous emission rate & optical extraction mechanism of a MQW
structure using MATLAB and FDTD simulation.
